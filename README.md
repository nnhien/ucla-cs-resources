# UCLA CS Resources
Links to resources that the UCLA CS Department offers, or useful for CS classes.

Feel free to add links for CS classes that you take here; Organizational structure hasn't been established but if it gets too messy I'll restructure it later

Please don't add links to problem set answers, past projects, etc. so we don't get screwed, thanks.

If for some reason you duplicate this repo for something, note that it's licensed under GPL 3. GPL 3 is self-propagting, so your repo must also be licensed under GPL 3.

## Contributing

Create a new branch, modify (or add; please use cs[coursenum].md for new files) the file you'd like to change with the repo, then create a PR. Request a review from someone. We'll just use the honor system for now to ensure no academic integrity problems crop up from using this repo, but if it ends up becoming a problem I'll enforce a certain group of people who need to review PR's.

# UCLA CS Resources
Links to resources that the UCLA CS Department offers, or useful for CS classes.

Feel free to add links for CS classes that you take here; Organizational structure hasn't been established but if it gets too messy I'll restructure it later

Please don't add links to problem set answers, past projects, etc. so we don't get screwed, thanks.
